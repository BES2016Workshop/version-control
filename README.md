# Introduction to version control for research

This tutorial introduces a basic workflow for version control using
git and the popular online hosting service, GitHub. The aim is to
provide a starting point for researchers who want to curate and
distribute their code.

* [Preliminaries](./prelim.md) Make sure that you have what you need to
get started

* **Using git on the command line**
    - [Getting started](./get_started.md) Start using git through a command line interface
    - [Getting your project under version control](./version_control.md) Set up version control on your project
    - [Connecting to a remote repository](./remote.md) Using GitHub as remote storage for your project
    - [Subsequent workflow](./workflow.md) Making updates to your project
    - [Summary](./summary.md) What we've learned and further steps
    - [When things go wrong](./when-things-go-wrong.md) A very quick intro into how to use git to
    rewind when things go wrong in your code. And how to escape text editors.

* **Using git through RStudio**
    * [Setting up a version controlled project](./rstudio_setup.md) Setting up a git project in RStudio
    * [Getting started with version control](./rstudio_vc.md) Setting up and using version control in RStudio
    * [Setting up a remote repository](./rstudio_remote.md) Using GitHub as remote storage for your project
    * [Subsequent workflow](./rstudio_updates.md) Making further changes to your project
    * [Summary](./rstudio_summary.md) What we've learned and further steps
