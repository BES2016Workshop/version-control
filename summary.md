## Summary

We've introduced the following basic git workflow using git on the command line:

**Local operations**

- Staging files:    `git add <file>`
- Committing changes:    `git commit`
- Inspecting your workspace:    `git status`
- Reviewing history:    `git log`

**Syncing with a remote**

- Pushing local changes:   `git push`
<!-- - Merging remote changes `git pull` -->
