## Summary

You have seen that the standard workflow loop for version control in
RStudio is very quick and simple:

* Make your change
* Stage your change
* Commit
* Push to GitHub

As well as this basic workflow, you've learned how to look at changes
using **Diff** and to inspect your project's history.

## Going further

Git and GitHub are extremely powerful and flexible systems and there
is a lot more you can learn if you wish. For further help on using git
